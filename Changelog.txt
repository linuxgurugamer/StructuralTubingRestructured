+-------------------------------+
|   CHANGELOG (latest first):   |
+-------------------------------+

1.0.8.1
	Added missing title to agent

1.0.8
	Updated for KSP 1.8

1.0.7.3
	Version bump for 1.5
	
1.0.7.2
	Fixed name and description for the 250, 300 and 500mm tubes (had cm
	instead of mm)

1.0.7.1
	Updated .version file for all 1.4
	Added Jenkins build

1.0.7
	Adoption by LinuxGuruGamer
	Updated mod for compatibility with KSP 1.4.1, now uses stock texture
	switching

1.0.6 - If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it 12/10/16
-Toiroids! Toruses. A Torum? We've got rings, people.
	0.625m - tweakscale from .3125 to 1.25
	1.25m - tweakscale from .625 to 2.5
	2.5m - tweakscale from 1.25 to 3.75
	Furthermore, they have a buttload of nodes. And should you find you want
	even MORE nodes, see the config file. If you use them for fuel stacks,
	be sure to toggle crossfeed on. Their collision mesh closely follows the
	visual model, so engines can thrust through them. However, intakes are
	still occluded by them, likely a node stack behavior, so idk. In some 
	cases, a little offset fixes this. 
-Tech levels changed.
	Previously all parts were under "composites", a Tier7 tech level. They
	have all been adjusted with regards to game balance and part complexity.
	Or just my whim. Either way,

	dont update until you've reached the "meta-materials" node. That's 550
	science. You could wipe your butt on Ike and mail the tissue home for 550 	
	science points. Also, R&D costs have been adjusted to follow suit.
	A more in-depth explanation can be seen in TechTreeChanges.txt.
-Test Criteria added to all parts.
	They can now be the subject of such menial contracts as "Test the 5m tube
	on escape trajectory out of Vall", and other such jewels. Have fun!
-Added stack symmetry to the tubular platform.
	Sorry I didnt do this to begin with. It now pairs attachments between the
	long sides, and their nodes. I've seen some weird behavior from this when
	in airplane-style symmetry, and trying to connect to the fore and aft
	nodes. If I find a better solution, I will employ it. In the interim, you
	can disbale it in the config file. I've left directions there.


1.0.5 - You're Gonna have a Ball 12/9/16
-4 new tube sections, courtesy of SpannerMonkey(smce).
	250cm straight
	300cm straight
	500cm straight
	Another H, but different. You'll see.
-Some new textures for Firespitter users, thanks to BureauJaeger.
-A new ball valve item for those that use these for plumbing.
	I kinda wish I had made the valve before allowing
	crossfeed on every part. Oh well, I've left that alone,
	so no broken .craft files, or ships that cant access
	their fuel tanks. That would suck.

1.0.4 - X Marks The Spot 12/5/16
-A new "X" hub, or four-way, or cross... super helpful little part.
	spanner is rockin and rollin on these parts.
-A tubular platform, with a mesh/grate inset. good for rover bases.
	my first part, all by myself! woohoo!



1.0.3 - Tee Time 12/2/16
-4 new parts, various tees.



1.0.2 - I'm a Doofus 11/30/16
-2 new parts - 1x1m "H", and .5x.5m 180*. Credit to SpannerMonkey(smce).
-FSTextureSwitch fixed. Thanks BureauJager and SpannerMonkey(smce).
-Tweakscale support added. 
	All parts set to "free", so scaling is by percentage.
-ModuleManager.2.7.5 included.
	(CC Share-Alike License - credit to sarbian, et al.)
	It fixed the Tweakscale issue (upgrading from 2.6.x) so i dunno.
-Agency "DK Salvage" fleshed out a bit more. 
	*SHOULD* offer contracts in career mode.
-Crossfeed Toggles on all parts.
-Added "grey.png" back to the FSTextureSwitch modules. (oops)



1.0.1 - Experimental Build 11/29/16
Consider this an experimental build because only half of the added functionality is working correctly. I'm done working on it for tonight, but didnt want to hold back what DOES work.



1.0 - Initial Release 11/25/16
-Eight tube sections (Elbows, straights, "H" hubs....)
-Texture Switch Support (camo and other cool shiz)
-Agency and Flag (Kinda janky, may revisit)
